\section{Preparation of the input states}
We have prepared a generic state on the Bloch sphere using the following two rotations:
\[
    \ket{\psi}=R_z(\phi)R_y(\theta)\ket{0}=\cos(\theta/2)\ket{0}+e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta/2)\ket{1},
\]

\[
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$} & \gate{R_y(\theta)}      & \gate{R_z(\phi)}      & \qw     & \rstick{\hspace{-4 mm}$\ket{\psi}$}  \\
\end{quantikz}
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.
For the preparation of an input state on the $xz$-equator, only the rotation about the $y$ axis is needed:
\[
    \ket{\psi}=R_y(\theta)\ket{0}=\cos(\theta/2)\ket{0}+\sin(\theta/2)\ket{1}.
\]
\[
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\ket{0}$} & \gate{R_y(\theta)}   & \qw     & \rstick{\hspace{-4 mm}$\ket{\psi}$}  \\
\end{quantikz}
\]
\section{Measurement of the fidelity of the copies}
The fidelity of the two copies can be measured directly. 
If the input state was $\ket{\psi}$, it is sufficient to perform a measurement in the $\{\ket{\psi},\ket{\psi_{\perp}}\}$ basis.
The fidelity corresponds to the probability of measuring $\ket{\psi}$.
Indeed, if the copies are $\rho_{1,2}$ and their fidelities with respect to the input state are $F_{1,2}$:
\[
    p_{1,2}^{\psi}=\Tr[\ketbra{\psi}{\psi} \rho_{1,2}]=\bra{\psi}\rho_{1,2}\ket{\psi}=F_{1,2}.
\]

Since $\ket{\psi}$ was prepared with the rotation $R_z(\phi)R_y(\theta)$, 
it follows that a measurement in the $\left\{\ket{\psi},\ket{\psi_{\perp}}\right\}$ basis can be performed implementing the opposite rotation and then measuring in the computational basis.

\[
\begin{quantikz}
    \lstick{$\rho_{1}$} & \gate{R_z(-\phi)}       & \gate{R_y(-\theta)}      & \meter{$\ket{0}$,$\ket{1}$} & p_0=F_1  \\
    \lstick{$\rho_{2}$} & \gate{R_z(-\phi)}       & \gate{R_y(-\theta)}      & \meter{$\ket{0}$,$\ket{1}$} & p_0=F_2  \\
\end{quantikz}
\]

It is worth mentioning that both the preparation and the fidelity measurement are not required in the normal use of QCMs, they are just a means of testing their performances.
It should therefore be taken into account that the additional gates could decrease the quality of the copies because of the greater depth of the run circuits.
