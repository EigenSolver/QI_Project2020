    abstract={If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom, there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

abstract = {Abstract In quantum mechanics, although the no-cloning theorem forbids us to clone an arbitrary quantum state ideally, it is still possible to partially reproduce an unknown quantum state by using a phase cloning machine. Since the no-cloning theorem guarantees the safety of quantum key distribution (QKD), resulting in the famous Bennettâ€“Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol, phase cloning of BB84 states increases the probability to eavesdrop the transmitted information between correspondents, forcing us to recheck the security of the QKD protocol. In this work, we realize an optimal phase cloning machine for BB84 states in a superconducting quantum bit (qubit). The lowest three energy levels in this system are exploited as logical qubits to demonstrate this cloning procedure. Two microwaves are used to prepare and clone the states. In order to achieve the maximum fidelity, we use the state tomography to readout the experimental results. It is found that the state information is well preserved during this cloning process. The average fidelity between input and output states is 83.92\%, making this a valid quantum cloning machine.},
