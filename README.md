# Working Repo for Quantum Information Project at TU Delft

Franscesco, Juan, Yuning

Logging:

Nov.22th, Sunday

1. Draw the circuit that we are using (the theoretical one mentioned here https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9801009.pdf), with the additional rotations. PAY ATTENTION: read carefully the paper to understand where the copies are made
2. Draw the circuit that we are running on starmon (with the swap gates!)
3. Start to write down the report for what we have done this week. In particular write down the theory. Analyse the circuit (the one in the paper) step by step (just like we did during the lecture) 
4. Run again on Starmon and QXSimulator
5. Run on IBM
